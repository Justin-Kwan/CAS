# Todo:

	- Clean up api to follow diagram
	- Test using Insomnia
	- Create Page Serving Front End with Node (only routes to pages!)
        - Have front end javascript check for existing tokens & redirect if so,
	  update html bars based on response codes, and set token response and redirect
          to next service


# Todo for later:

	- Make a user-auth server that gives and checks tokens only!
	- rename current UserAuth service to user-management
		- can delete user, reset password, etc
	- user-management asks user-auth for token on login (giving userid for payload)
