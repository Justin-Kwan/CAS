#Server Refactoring

  - test index.py determineRedirectPage() - CANNOT DO
  - have username char limit (35)
  - move out input handler to another class and move the "loop" to runComponents() in another class (each for signup and login) and with username, password and inputHandlers

  - change button color?
  - Need Google's Captcha
